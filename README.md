Develop an algorithm to solve the N Queen problem. 

The N Queen problem is as follow: 
Place n queens in n x n chessboard such that no queen is attacking another queen.

**Python** language was used to solve this problem. And, **PIL library** was used to draw the board and visualize the solution.

This project was for Data Structure course. And, I was part of a group of 2 students.
